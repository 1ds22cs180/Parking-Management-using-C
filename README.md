# my_mini_project
In This Repo, I have created a Simple Parking Management System using C language.
Code Explaination:
1. The code is divided into 3 parts: parking allotment, vehicle Exit, and Amount Received
2. parking allotment: This part of the code is used to create a parking lot with a specified
                      number of slots.
3. vehicle Exit: This part is used to tell which vehicle Exitted from Parking.
4. Amount Received: This part of the code is used to display the amount received from a vehicle that was Parked.

Can be run via Online C compilers.
